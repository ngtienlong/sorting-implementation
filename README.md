# Sorting visualizer

A sorting visualizer that built on

-   Python 3
-   colorama
-   Time

# Algorithm (to be) implemente(d)

[X] Bubble Sort
[X] Merge Sort
[] Quick Sort

# Project to-dos:

[] Create a random array to be sorted (20 in length?)
[] Print out the unsorted array
[] Implement algorithms:
[] Print out the sorted algorithm
[] Calculate the time
[] Implement test for algorithm
~[] Visualize (Need to think in detail)~
