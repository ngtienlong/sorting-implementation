# Sorting visualizer

A sorting visualizer that built on

-   Python 3
-   colorama
-   Time

# Algorithm (to be) implemente(d)

-   [x] Implement test for algorithm
-   [x] Bubble Sort
-   [x] Merge Sort
-   [x] Quick Sort

# Project to-dos:

-   [x] Create a random array to be sorted ~((20 in length?))~, now have option to choose
-   [x] Print out the unsorted array in red
-   [x] Implement algorithms
-   [x] Print out the sorted algorithm -[X] Calculate the time
-   ~[] Visualize (Need to think in detail)~
